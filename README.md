# miniproject2

1. I downloaded two catgories of images. Hamburger and Hotdog, each 30 images. using a library downloaded from pypi called google_images_download. And put them in a folder called food.

2. I created a folder called example_code and download example code from github using tensroflow to train and recognise the images.

3. Then I ran the retrain.py and train the images downloaded in food folder. It takes about 20 min. 

4. After the retrain process. You can open tensorboard and see the train graph.

5. This is the step of testing the retrained images. I test a hunburger image and the result is 0.999hamburger. So the result is accurate.
the result of images are in the base folder


Neurala:
The exprot folder is the trained result from newrala.
